# Let-s_Secure_it

Maintaining secrecy is very important in a large corporation and because of
the intelligent of the hackers it becomes tedious. Already we have cryptography for
transmitting secret information. Even though cryptography successfully transmitting
secret information, it will give a suspicion to the hackers and it affects unintended
users.

## About Let's Secure it

The project, Let's Secure it overcomes this factor and
provides ways to transmit information with encryption and security without affecting
the foreknowledge of other. Steganography implements multimedia data as a covering
medium (Covering secret information). By using steganography data (secret
information) can be kept hidden within the covering medium (multimedia data, here
multimedia data is an image) and it can be sent anywhere and by any means of
communication easily without giving any knowledge to others.
